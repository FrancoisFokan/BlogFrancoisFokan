•	***October 15th:*** This month I started to learn english. For that, I watch most films and series in original version. I also have a lot of friends who help me learn. Without forgetting the most important: the english lessons.

•	***October 20th:*** My learning of the english language continues every day. In addition, I now understand the language a little better thanks to the English lessons and to the series and films in original version. This week, I have found at home a few conjugation and grammar books, as well as a book with 200 small tests to progress in English.
