|     General Topic                           |     Monkeys, like humans, persist at tasks that they have   already invested in.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
|     Procedure/ What   Was Examined ?        |     A study shows that   capuchin monkeys and rhesus macaques are sensitive to a human behavior. It’s   about the reluctantce to give up on something they've already committed   time and effort to. Capuchin Monkeys and Rhesus Macaques participated in   cognitive and behavioral research. It can be a mechanism that helps us   balance overall costs and benefits, and which can be influenced by   uncertainty about the outcome.    |
|     Conclusions/   Discovery                |     The researchers found   that both species of monkeys took longer to achieve the performance, and the   more they tried, the more they tried to accomplish the whole task. Monkeys   were less susceptible to sunk cost behavior. Further, this behavior is   probably motivated by evolution. It reminds us that sometimes there is a good   reason to give up.                                                                          |
