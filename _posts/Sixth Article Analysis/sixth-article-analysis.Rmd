|     General Topic                           |     Monkeys, like humans, persist at   tasks they've already invested in                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
|     Procedure/ What   Was Examined ?        |     A study shows that capuchin monkeys and   rhesus macaques are sensitive to human behavior. It’s about the reluctantce to give up on something   they've already committed time and effort to. 26 Capuchin Monkeys and 7 Rhesus Macaques participated in entirely   voluntary and non-invasive cognitive and behavioral research. It can be a mechanism that helps us balance overall costs and   benefits, and which can be influenced by uncertainty about the outcome.    |
|     Conclusions/   Discovery                |     The researchers found that both species of   monkeys performed longer than was optimal, and the more they tried, the more   they had to complete the entire task. Monkeys were less susceptible to sunk   cost behavior.  The human capacities   are probably not the main drivers of the expensive phenomenon. More, this   behavior is probably motivated by evolution. It reminds us that sometimes   there is a good reason to give up.                                 |
