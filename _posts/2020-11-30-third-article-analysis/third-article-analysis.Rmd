|     General   Topic                         |     Coppery Titi monkeys do not deceive their partners.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
|     Procedure/   What Was Examined ?        |     By most species,   one proportion of offspring is not issu by their social father. Indeed, many   pair-living animal species do not have partnership fidelity as important.   Coppery Titi monkeys (living in the Amazon lowland rainforest) are maybe an   exception. Scientists could not find evidence for extra-pair paternity in   their study population in Peru.                                             |
|     Conclusions/   Discovery                |     To have the best possible genes, individuals can use the genes of a   another male without giving up the security of their territory and the social   father. But, in Coppery titi monkeys, mate choice seems to be so successful   that no genetic advantage does not worth the social costs of infidelity. None   offspring examined were not sired by the social father. So, genetic monogamy   is confirmed.    |
