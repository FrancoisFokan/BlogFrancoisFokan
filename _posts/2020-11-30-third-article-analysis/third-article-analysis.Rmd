|     General   Topic                         |     Coppery titi monkeys do not deceive their partners.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
|     Procedure/   What Was Examined ?        |     By most species,   one proportion of offspring is not issu by their social father because many pair-living   animal species do not have partnership fidelity as important. Coppery titi   monkeys (living in the Amazon lowland rainforest) are maybe an exception.   Scientists could not find evidence for extra-pair paternity in their study   population in Peru.                                                                                      |
|     Conclusions/   Discovery                |     To have the best possible genes, individuals can use the genes of a   neighbor or another male without giving up the security of their territory   and the social father.     But, in Coppery titi monkeys, mate choice seems to be so successful   that no potential genetic advantage does not worth the social costs of   infidelity. No one of the offspring examined were not sired by the social   father, so genetic monogamy could be confirmed.    |
