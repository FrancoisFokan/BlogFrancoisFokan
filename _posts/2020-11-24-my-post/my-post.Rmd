|     General   Topic                         |     In Hainan, a landslide has torn a huge gap in the forest. Which involves   that the Hainan Gibbon (Nomascus hainanus) have difficulty to live. Therefore,   Scientists built a rope bridge reconnecting the trees and temporary help the   rarest primate in the world.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
|     Procedure/   What Was Examined ?        |     Gibbons are climbing and swinging very easily. Some used the ropes as   a handrail, others swung by their arms and the most daring walked the   tightrope. In the group, all the 9 individuals knows how to use the rope   bridge perfectly. Except for one adult male, which made a mighty jump from   one tree to another, sometimes accompanied by athletic teenage companions.   Other primates, as orangutan, use the artificial rope bridges because Hainan   Gibbon has learned them the ropes.    |
|     Conclusions/   Discovery                |     In 2003, there were only 2 groups with a total of 13 individuals in   the entire world. There was a slight recovery with the appearance of 2 new   groups in 2011 and 2015. Luckily, a fifth group appeared at the start of 2020   and the world population has bounced back to over 30 individuals.                                                                                                                                                                     |
|     Remaining   Questions                   |     20 species of gibbons exist in the world, but they are almost all   threatened. They are as well almost all classified as Critically Endangered   by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
