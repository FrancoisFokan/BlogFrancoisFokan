Thanks for taking your time to take a look at my work !

This blog has allowed me to learn to master different computer tools and to improve my English enormously considerably. It forced me to work regularly and taught me a lot. It was a very nice and pleasing experience, which made me discover a lot of things about primates and about biologicalscience, more generally.

Did you enjoy reading these article analysis ? And most importantly, did you learn things that you did not know? I hope so anyways.

To find all the sources that allowed me to create this Blog, go to the "***Bibliography***" section. There you will find the link to all the original articles.

If you ever have any questions as a result of what you have just read, please do not hesitate to contact me. I would be happy to answer you.

## Special Thanks :
