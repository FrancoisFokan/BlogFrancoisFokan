|     General Topic                           |     The   N.I.H. refuses to move 39 aging and sick laboratory chimps from the   Alamogordo Primate Center to Chimp Haven sanctuary in Louisiana.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
|     Procedure/ What   Was Examined ?        |     The 39 chimpanzees from the Alamogordo   Primate Center have been involved in hormonal studies for years, and have   undergone a number of liver biopsies. The N.I.H. decided that all chimpanzees   would be permanently withdrawn from the research. However, chimpanzees deemed   too fragile to be moved would remain in Alamogordo, as they would suffer and   could even die if transferred to the sanctuary. In addition, the practice of   isolating sick chimpanzees could lead to depression and worsen loss of   appetite.    |
|     Conclusions/   Discovery                |     The lack of   outside oversight of chimpanzee end-of-life care was a major problem. Today,   the lives of chimpanzees have improved since the days when they were subjects   of medical research, subjected to biopsies and other procedures. Chimpanzees   are not locked inside and do not undergo invasive experiences. They are with   caretakers and vets who have looked after them for years.                                                                                                                                     |
|     Remaining   Questions                   |     There   are deeper ethical issues that go beyond physical health. The quality of life   for a chimpanzee should be discussed from different points of view.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
