|     General Topic                           |     The N.I.H. refuses to move aging and sick laboratory   chimps from the Alamogordo Primate Center to Chimp Haven sanctuary in   Louisiana.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
|     Procedure/ What   Was Examined ?        |     Chimpanzees from the   Alamogordo Primate Center have been involved in hormonal studies for years   and have undergone a number of liver biopsies. The N.I.H. decided that   chimpanzees deemed too fragile to be moved would remain in Alamogordo, as   they would suffer and could even die if transferred to the sanctuary.                                                                                                       |
|     Conclusions/   Discovery                |     The practice of isolating sick chimpanzees lead to   depression and worsen loss of appetite. More, the lack of chimpanzee   end-of-life care was a major problem. But the lives of chimpanzees have   improved since the days when they were subjects of medical research.   Chimpanzees are not locked inside and do not undergo invasive experiences.   They are with caretakers and vets who have looked after them for years.    |
|     Remaining   Questions                   |     There are deeper ethical issues that go beyond physical   health. The quality of life for a chimpanzee should be discussed from   different points of view.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
