Here you will find a whole series of ***scientific article reviews concerning the behaviour of primates***. But that's not all !

You can also find the different sections down there:

-	**About Me**
That’s right, who is François Fokan?

-	**About Primates**
It seems important to start at the beginning.

-	**My English Activity Log (M.E.A.L.)**
All about my progress in English.

-	**Graphic Description**
A collaboration with the SDD course.

-	**Introduction, Conclusion & Bibliography**

Why did I decide to deal with this topic? I've always been very interested in zoology and in particular ethology, the study of animal behavior. So the ***Primate Behavior*** topic was perfect.

I recommend the "***About Me***" section to find out everything about my background and my motivations.

Good reading !

Francois.
